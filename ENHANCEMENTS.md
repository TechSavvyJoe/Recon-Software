# Vehicle Reconditioning Tracker - Enhanced Features Summary

## New Features Added

### 1. Title In-House Tracking
- Added checkbox toggle for "Title In House" status
- Title must be in-house before vehicle can be marked as "Lot Ready"
- Visual indicator shows red/green status based on title availability

### 2. Enhanced Mechanical Workflow
- **Three-stage mechanical process**:
  1. **Email Sent**: Initial service request sent to service manager
  2. **In Service**: Vehicle picked up by technician for inspection/service
  3. **Completed**: Mechanical work finished and vehicle returned

- **Timer functionality**: Time tracking starts when email is first sent
- **Email simulation**: Click "Send Email" to trigger service request
- **Progressive workflow**: Must complete each step in order

### 3. Timeline-Style UI
- **Visual timeline** with icons and progress indicators
- **Color-coded status**:
  - Gray: Pending
  - Yellow: In Progress  
  - Green: Completed
- **Sub-step tracking** for mechanical work
- **Progress rings** for partially completed steps

### 4. Enhanced Lot Ready Logic
- Vehicle can only be "Lot Ready" when ALL requirements are met:
  - ✅ Mechanical work completed
  - ✅ Detailing completed
  - ✅ Photos completed
  - ✅ Title in-house
- **Visual checklist** shows completion status
- **Smart status updates** based on workflow progress

### 5. Flexible Workflow Order
- Can start detailing and photos before mechanical is complete
- Mechanical can be initiated at any time with email request
- Status automatically updates based on most recent completed step
- Timeline preserves order of actual completion

## Technical Implementation

### New Data Structure
```javascript
workflow: {
  'New Arrival': { completed: true, date: '...', notes: '...' },
  'Mechanical': { 
    completed: false, 
    subSteps: {
      'email-sent': { completed: true, date: '...', notes: '...' },
      'in-service': { completed: false },
      'completed': { completed: false }
    }
  },
  'Detailing': { completed: false },
  'Photos': { completed: false },
  'Title': { completed: false, inHouse: false },
  'Lot Ready': { completed: false },
  'Sold': { completed: false }
}
```

### New Functions Added
- `toggleTitleInHouse(stockNum)` - Toggle title in-house status
- `updateMechanicalSubStep(stockNum, subStepId)` - Update mechanical workflow steps
- `completeWorkflowStep(stockNum, step)` - Mark workflow step as complete
- `getWorkflowStatus(vehicle)` - Initialize/get workflow data
- `canBeLotReady(vehicle)` - Check if vehicle meets lot ready criteria
- `getStepProgress(vehicle, step)` - Calculate step completion percentage
- `updateWorkflowStep(vehicle, step, subStep, data)` - Update workflow data

### CSS Enhancements
- Timeline container with connecting lines
- Progress indicators and status colors
- Hover effects and transitions
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Sub-step styling for mechanical workflow

## User Interface Improvements

### Vehicle Detail Modal
- **Two-column layout**: Vehicle info + Timeline
- **Interactive timeline** with clickable buttons
- **Real-time updates** when steps are completed
- **Title checkbox** for easy status toggle
- **Lot Ready indicator** with requirements checklist

### Dashboard Enhancements

- Click to open detailed timeline view

### Workflow Board

## Business Logic

### Mechanical Workflow Process
1. **Email Sent**: Service manager receives email notification
2. **Timer Starts**: Tracks time from initial email
3. **In Service**: Tech picks up vehicle for work
4. **Completed**: Work finished, vehicle returned

### Status Determination
- Status automatically updates based on furthest completed step
- Title status affects final "Lot Ready" eligibility
- Flexible order allows parallel work streams

### Quality Control
- All steps must be explicitly marked complete
- Title must be physically in-house
- Visual indicators prevent premature status changes

## Future Enhancements (Ready for Implementation)
- Email integration for actual service requests
- Time tracking and reporting
- Photo upload functionality
- Service cost tracking
- Automated notifications
- Integration with inventory management systems

## Files Modified
- `/public/index.html` - Added timeline CSS styles and modal containers
- `/public/main.js` - Enhanced with new workflow functions and UI
- Sample data updated with new workflow structure

## Testing
- All functions tested for syntax errors
- Sample data includes various workflow states
- Timeline UI responsive and interactive
- Modal functionality preserved and enhanced
