## File Organization History

### Original Structure (Messy)
- Files scattered across src/ and public/
- Multiple test files with overlapping functionality
- Numerous backup versions without clear purpose
- Duplicate code in multiple files

### Current Structure (Clean)
```
public/                 # Production application
archive/
├── backup-files/      # Essential backups only
├── documentation/     # Development history
└── test-files/       # Testing utilities
```

## Dependencies

### External Libraries (CDN)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework
- **Font Awesome**: Icons
- **Chart.js**: Analytics charts
- **PapaParse**: CSV parsing

### No Local Dependencies
- Zero npm packages required for runtime
- Self-contained application
- No build process needed

## Deployment Options

1. **Static File Hosting**
   - Upload public/ folder to any web server
   - Works with GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.

2. **Local Development**
   - Open index.html directly in browser
   - Use local server for enhanced features

3. **Enterprise Deployment**
   - Can be integrated into existing systems
   - Data layer can be swapped for database backend

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance (Minimal Required)
- Monitor browser console for errors
- Update CDN links if needed
- Clear localStorage if data corruption occurs
